Coding a QEMU device emulator for an OCP NVMe device involves a fairly complex process that requires knowledge of both QEMU's internal architecture and the specifics of NVMe and OCP (Open Compute Project) specifications. Here’s a high-level overview of the steps involved in creating such an emulator:

Understand QEMU’s Device Emulation Architecture:
QEMU utilizes a modular architecture to emulate various devices. You will need to get familiar with how QEMU handles device emulation, including how it integrates devices with its system emulator.
Familiarize Yourself with NVMe and OCP Specifications:
NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) is a protocol designed to access high-speed storage media via the PCI Express (PCIe) bus. OCP specifications might modify or add to the standard NVMe specifications for specific deployments.
Understanding these specifications is crucial as your device emulation will need to accurately reflect the behavior of an NVMe device under the OCP guidelines.
Set Up a QEMU Development Environment:
Download and build QEMU from source. You will need to have a development environment with dependencies for QEMU installed.
Typically, you will need tools like gcc, make, and libraries specific to your development platform.
Create a New Device Model in QEMU:
Implement a new device model in QEMU. This involves writing C code to define the behavior of your OCP NVMe device.
You will need to create functions to handle I/O operations, device initialization, and other specifics of the NVMe protocol as it applies to OCP.
Integrate and Test the Device:
After coding the device, integrate it with QEMU’s build system. Add your device to the QEMU configuration and make system.
Compile QEMU and test your device by running QEMU with the -device argument to include your NVMe device.
Debugging and Validation:
Debugging is an integral part of developing an emulation. Use tools like gdb to troubleshoot issues.
Validate the device’s operation against the NVMe and OCP specifications to ensure it behaves as expected.
Documentation:
Document your code and the setup process. This is helpful for future development and for users of your emulation model.
This is just a very basic guide, and each step involves significant challenges, especially in terms of programming and understanding the underlying hardware protocols. If you're new to QEMU or device emulation, it might be beneficial to start with simpler projects or tutorials on QEMU device emulation.

Sure, I can provide you with a basic sample of how to start creating a custom NVMe device in QEMU. Below, you'll find a simple skeleton of C code that sets up the structure for an NVMe device. This code doesn't implement full functionality but serves as a starting point to understand how to integrate a new device into QEMU.

Explanation:
Structure Definition: We define OCPNVMeState, which includes the PCIDevice structure and any specific properties or memory regions your device will use.
Realize and Uninit Functions: These functions handle the device initialization and cleanup. ocp_nvme_realize sets up memory regions and registers the device with the PCI subsystem. The ocp_nvme_uninit function is for cleaning up when the device is removed or on shutdown.
Class Initialization: Here, we set the device's vendor, device, and class IDs. These IDs should be changed according to the specifics of your NVMe device under the OCP specification.
Type Registration: We register the device type with QEMU's object system, allowing QEMU to instantiate the device based on the type name.
This code is meant to be compiled as part of the QEMU source tree. It's quite advanced, so if you are not familiar with device emulation or QEMU’s internal coding, you might need additional learning or professional assistance.
